Since then, private digital detectives like myself have spent countless hours going back through the fingerprints of Instagram, Bravo clips, and Reddit to find out what really happened. And a lot happened — enough for a detailed timeline dating back to 2013. The stakes of this drama feel higher than those of any other reality-TV couple, and these people, whom we’ve followed with hungry, shallow interest, are acting intensely in character.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clezw9gby00173b6r7tj2ew8q@published data-word-count=96>With more episodes of Vanderpump Rules on their way (and an emergency episode coined, you guessed it, “<a href=#>Scandoval”</a>), it’s necessary to catch you up to speed on all the drama surrounding the series, the exes, and the actual restraining orders. (Before we go on, I just want to clarify one thing: Andy Cohen <a href=#>can attest</a> to the fact that I was the first to add “<a href=#>#Scandoval</a>” to the Bravo lexicon.) Read on for the essential #Scandoval timeline, and remember that we will still have to wait until May to see the reunion play out on television.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clezwccr2000e3b6vhrbfcr3f@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>The Background (2013–2021)</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clezw9gg400193b6r3cmqhu4b@published data-word-count=3><strong>January 7, 2013:</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clezw9gj0001a3b6rfw0ffr6c@published data-word-count=69><a href=#>Vanderpump Rules</a>, a show profiling the young, attractive servers and bartenders of restaurateur Lisa Vanderpump’s West Hollywood restaurant SUR (Sexy Unique Restaurant), premieres.

This was just another public relations stunt by Rachel and her team. If Rachel really wanted to make this go away, she would come out and publicly say the ‘punch’ never happened and she is sorry for all the harm she caused Scheana, Ariana, and her other friends.” The false document also uses Leviss’s stage name, Raquel Leviss, as opposed to her legal name, Rachel Leviss.

Mandel’s production company, Alevy, is headed by one Kimmie Bader, who — you guessed it — is married to Sandoval’s bud.

They slept together once, they say, and then put the relationship to bed. They never had sex in Sandoval and Madix’s shared home; and Leviss never accompanied Sandoval back to his hometown of St. Louis, Missouri, which had been alleged by some.
